The National Human Exposure Assessment Survey (NHEXAS) is a federal interagency research effort coordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD). Phase I consists of demonstration/scoping studies using probability-based sampling designs. The Region 5 study was conducted in EPA's Region 5 (Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Minnesota), and included personal exposure, residential concentration, and biomarker measurements of metals and VOCs. The study was conducted by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI). The scope and design of the study are detailed in the following article: E. Pellizzari et al., Population-Based Exposure Measurements in EPA Region 5: A Phase I Field Study in Support of the National Human Exposure Assessment Survey.
